1. Blockchain Sector (Your Business Logic)

This is your smart contract running on Ethereum (or local Hardhat/Anvil/Ganache).

It handles:

Business rules (loans, donations, repayments).

Storing only the minimum required data on-chain.

Emitting events whenever something important happens.
Example: Donated(donor, amount).

Think of this as the official record keeper. It’s expensive and slow because it’s decentralized and permanent.

2. The Graph Node Sector (Your Data Indexer)

Watches the blockchain for your events.

Runs your subgraph mappings → translates blockchain data into structured entities (like tables in SQL).

Stores everything in a PostgreSQL database.

Gives you a GraphQL API to query that data super fast.

This sector is read-heavy, optimized for fast queries, not for writing logic.

3. Frontend Sector (Input/Output Layer)

Users interact with this layer (website, dApp, etc.).

For actions that change state (donate, borrow, repay):

Frontend sends transactions to Blockchain Sector (costs gas).

For data display (list donations, show stats):

Frontend queries The Graph Node via GraphQL (free & instant).

So yes, that’s the full picture:

Blockchain → official records, expensive writes.

Graph Node → event listener + data indexer, free queries.

Frontend → connects everything together.

explication expanded about Graphql Node:

1. What started up

Postgres → stores your subgraph data (indexed events → queryable tables).

IPFS → stores your subgraph metadata and mappings.

Graph Node → connects to your blockchain, listens for events, transforms them into GraphQL entities, and stores them in Postgres.

2. Key URLs to use now

GraphQL endpoint:
http://localhost:8000 → you’ll query your data here.

Admin endpoint:
http://localhost:8020 → used by graph deploy CLI.

IPFS Web UI:
http://localhost:5001/webui

Subgraph Index Node:
http://localhost:8030 → internal index info.

Metrics:
http://localhost:8040 → Prometheus metrics.

3. Next steps: Deploy your subgraph

Now that the node is running, you can:

graph create --node http://localhost:8020/ loan-machine
graph deploy --node http://localhost:8020/ --ipfs http://localhost:5001 loan-machine

This will take your subgraph.yaml + schema.graphql + mappings and register them with the node.

4. Query your data

Once deployed, open:

http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/loan-machine/graphql

You can run GraphQL queries like:

{
donations {
id
amount
donor
timestamp
}
}

5. Big picture

Your blockchain emits events → Graph Node listens → stores them in Postgres → exposes a GraphQL API.

Queries on GraphQL are fast and don’t cost gas, because they read from Postgres, not the chain.
